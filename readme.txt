Program created by Nader K
Filename: Program4.java
This application processes the two data files sections.txt and register.txt,
to show which classes students have signed up for,for the current semester.
The program will report the list of available sections, then report the name 
of each student and the sections they registered for.
The program will also report errors when there are duplicate sections, 
any attempts to register for a section that does not exist, or when a student tries 
to register again in  the same section.
